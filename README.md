# My Topic Google Doodle

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a 2017 action-adventure game developed and published by Nintendo. Set at the end of the Zelda timeline, the player controls Link as he sets out to save Princess Zelda and prevent Calamity Ganon from destroying the world. Players explore the open world of Hyrule, which is unstructured and encourages exploration and experimentation; the story can be completed in a nonlinear fashion, making it one of few Zelda games to impliment nonlinear storytelling. Breath of the Wild is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Journalists described it as a landmark in open-world design for its emphasis on experimentation, physics-based sandbox, and emergent gameplay. Numerous developers cited Breath of the Wild as inspiration, and it is a popular point of comparison among open-world games. During the time of this project, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was set to release, and my Google Doodle is a reflection of my excitement for the title.
